* Rusty Cat
A less featured filled cat clone written in rust.
Implemented as an excercise from the book "Command line rust"

** Usage
 ~catr FILE_NAME~ to print out file
*** Flags
I have implemented the ~-n~ and ~-b~ flags for this program, they work much like they do for cat.
The ~-n~ flag will number lines in the file
The ~-b~ flag will number all nonblank lines in a file
If in doubt you can always run ~-h~ or ~--help~ the built in instructions
